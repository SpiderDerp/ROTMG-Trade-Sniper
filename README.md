Ever just wanted to trade with someone on RealmEye but they were offline?

Well now, you can use this program to inform you when that person gets online! All you have to do is download the following dependencies:
json
requests
playsound

Make sure to change the file path in line 28 to the one that crab rave is in.
Just run the code, type in your target, then wait till crab rave starts playing, notifying you that their status has changed.

Have fun trading!
